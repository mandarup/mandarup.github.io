    "# Programming A Real Self Driving Car\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explains how to implement core components of the backend of a self driving car, which includes traffic lights detection, steering and throttle control, and waypoint following. Core logic is implemented using python and ROS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/mandarup/CarND-Capstone)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was  tested in a simulator and then  deployed on a real car, giving it self driving capability. Below is a video recording from the deployment run, demonstrating smooth braking and stopping at a stop light and then acceleration. The waypoints of this route are predefined for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following. Code is tested using a simulator, and only after thourough testing, is deployed on a real car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project. The ROS nodes and topics shown in the diagram are described briefly in the Code Structure section below, and more detail is provided for each node in later classroom concepts of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next,  section covers some module specific details.\n",

    "## Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traffic Light Detector\n",
    "\n",
    "![Traffic Light Detector](programming-a-self-driving-car/tl-node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This package contains the traffic light detection node: `tl_detector.py`. This node takes in data from the `/image_color`, `/current_pose`, and `/base_waypoints` topics and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the `/traffic_waypoint` topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The /current_pose topic provides the vehicle's current position, and `/base_waypoints` provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node. Traffic light detection  takes place within `tl_detector.py`, whereas traffic light classification  takes place within `../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Waypoint Updater\n",
    "\n",
    "![Waypoint Updater](programming-a-self-driving-car/waypoint-updater-node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This package contains the waypoint updater node: `waypoint_updater.py`. The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacle detection data. This node will subscribe to the `/base_waypoints`, `/current_pose`, `/obstacle_waypoint`, and `/traffic_waypoint` topics, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car with target velocities to the `/final_waypoints` topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drive-by-Wire (DBW) Node\n",
    "\n",
    "![DBW Node](programming-a-self-driving-car/dbw-node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The car used for deployment is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control. This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle: the node dbw_node.py and the file twist_controller.py, along with a pid and lowpass filter that  is used in the  implementation. The `dbw_node` subscribes to the `/current_velocity` topic along with the /twist_cmd topic to receive target linear and angular velocities. Additionally, this node will subscribe to `/vehicle/dbw_enabled`, which indicates if the car is under dbw or driver control. This node will publish throttle, brake, and steering commands to the `/vehicle/throttle_cmd`, `/vehicle/brake_cmd`, and `/vehicle/steering_cmd` topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these packages, the following packages are taken off-the-shelf without any changes. The styx and styx_msgs packages are used to provide a link between the simulator and ROS, and to provide custom ROS message types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/styx/\n",
    "A package that contains a server for communicating with the simulator, and a bridge to translate and publish simulator messages to ROS topics.\n",
    "- (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/styx_msgs/\n",
    "A package which includes definitions of the custom ROS message types used in the project.\n",
    "- (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/waypoint_loader/\n",
    "A package which loads the static waypoint data and publishes to /base_waypoints.\n",
    "- (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/waypoint_follower/\n",
    "A package containing code from Autoware which subscribes to /final_waypoints and publishes target vehicle linear and angular velocities in the form of twist commands to the /twist_cmd topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
