#### Version 1 - Monolithic App

Version 1 used a monolithic architecture as depicted in fig below:


Several versions of chat models are available with  architectural variations,
- Character RNN
- Word level RNN
- Word level Seq2Seq with attention, based on Neural Machine Translation model
- Word level Transformer model

Original idea was to allow users choose and compare different models, but
this feature is currently disabled as current hosting capacity is limited
for this hobby project. At the time of writing the model deployed is Seq2Seq,
but this may change without any notice or update to this document. 


#### Version 2 - Microservices approach

This is currently under development. Separating chatbot inference part
from the frontend will allow easy management of models without
messing with the frontend server. Also, this will offer some freedom on the model
serving part and allow experimentation with native (to modeling library) tools such as
tf-serving.
