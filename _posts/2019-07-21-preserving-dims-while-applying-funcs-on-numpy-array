I was trying to  normalize  3d tensors along specific dims. This stackoverflow [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42460217/how-to-normalize-a-4d-numpy-array) came in handy

```python
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand((10, 2, 5))

_min = x_train.min(axis=(0, 1), keepdims=True)
_max = x_train.max(axis=(0, 1), keepdims=True)
# (v - v_min)/(v_max - v_min)

_mean = x_train.mean(axis=(0, 1), keepdims=True)
_std = x_train.std(axis=(0, 1), keepdims=True)

_mean.shape
# (1,1,5)

# then x_train can be normalized easily with
((x_train - _mean) / _std).mean(axis=(0, 1), keepdims=True)
```
