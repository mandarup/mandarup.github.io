In Flask this can be done using the `g` object:
```python
from flask import g

def get_db():
    if 'db' not in g:
        g.db = connect_to_database()

    return g.db

@app.teardown_appcontext
def teardown_db():
    db = g.pop('db', None)

    if db is not None:
        db.close()
```

In Starlette this can be done using requests object like:

```python
# For stuff that has a request/response lifespan, you can store arbitrary stuff on the request "scope".
request["foo"] = whatever().

# For lifespan, use globals, with
@app.on_event('startup')
@app.on_event('shutdown')
# to setup and teardown any network connections or other resources.
```
