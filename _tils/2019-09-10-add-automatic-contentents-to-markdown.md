##### Table of Contents (ToC)

A ToC is so awesome and easy to produce. Have you noticed our ToC on this post? It's generated automatically by Kramdown with this simple markup:

```
- TOC
{:toc}
```

All the file headings will be all automatically included in the ToC, except for those we don't want there. For these, we apply a class called no_toc, and Kramdown will respect our will:

```
#### This heading will not be included in the ToC.
{: .no_toc}
```

And of course, we can make the ToC an ordered list instead of unordered:

```
1. TOC
{:toc}
```
